%CCDM.INITIALIZE
% CCDM.INITIALIZE(p,n) 
% select a desired distribution vektor p, desired output length n.
%
% [p_quant,num_info_bits,n_i] = CCDM.INITIALIZE(p,n)
% p_quant is the n-type distribution approximating p.
% num_info_bits is the input length for the encoder.
% n_i is the counting vector whose jth entry is the number of times the
% letter j will occure in the output sequences of ccdm.encode. Note that
% p_quant = n_i./n.
